# Single image that serves every network transport of the `tlsfp` VGI worker:
#   docker run ... IMG            -> HTTP server on $PORT      (default; Fly.io / local)
#   docker run ... IMG tcp        -> raw Arrow-IPC over TCP on $PORT_TCP
#   docker run -i ... IMG stdio   -> stdio worker DuckDB spawns on-host
# See docker-entrypoint.sh.
#
# Like vgi-units this worker is STATELESS: every fingerprint is pure,
# deterministic compute over the handshake bytes handed to it (no model
# registry, no cache, no per-attach state), so there is no /data volume and no
# `farm.query.vgi.volumes` mount-discovery label. The image is just the binary +
# a tiny entrypoint.
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ---- build stage -----------------------------------------------------------
# Pinned glibc (bookworm) so the binary links against the same libc the slim
# runtime ships. The tlsfp workspace depends only on crates.io crates (vgi,
# md-5, sha2), so no git is needed at build time.

WORKDIR /src

# Copy the whole workspace (manifests + sources + lockfile). The cargo registry
# and target dir are BuildKit cache mounts, so the binary is copied OUT to a
# non-cache path before the layer ends (cache mounts don't persist in the image).

# debian-slim (not distroless) so the HEALTHCHECK below has a real `curl`. The
# HTTP transport is plain inbound HTTP (no TLS in the dependency tree), so no
